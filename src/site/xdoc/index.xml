      <p>
        The RMIIO library provides classes for robust usage of RMI (or other
        RPC framework), primarily for streaming data.  One common usage is
        streaming files to/from a remote EJB or some other RMI server.  The
        RMIIO library is licensed under the
        <a href="license.html">GNU Lesser General Public License</a>
        and is part of the <a href="http://openhms.sourceforge.net/">OpenHMS</a> project.

        For a variety of code examples see the snippets in the
        <a href="apidocs/com/healthmarketscience/rmiio/package-summary.html#package_description">rmiio package javadocs</a>
        as well as the working examples in the
        <a href="xref-test/index.html">test directory</a>.

        <p>
          As of RMIIO release 1.1.0, the streaming implementation classes have
          been abstracted from the RPC framework infrastructure.  The <a href="apidocs/com/healthmarketscience/rmiio/exporter/package-summary.html#package_description">exporter package</a> has been added to enable the remote

          stream implementations to be utilized within any RPC framework.  The
          RemoteStreamExporter class can be implemented to tie the remote
          stream implementations to whatever RPC mechanism is desired, the
          default being RMI.  There is some proof-of-concept code in the
          <code>src/corbaExample</code> directory showing CORBA being used as
          the RPC framework, including a c++ client written using <a href="http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/">omniORB</a> which consumes a

          remote stream from a java server.  Additionally, this should enable
          the remote streams to eventually be integrated into the <a href="http://labs.jboss.com/jbossremoting/">JBoss Remoting</a> framework.
