<p>
Provides classes for robust usage of RMI, primarily for streaming data.  One
common usage is streaming files to/from a remote EJB or some other RMI server.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>RemoteRetry</h3>

<p>
This facility provides a basis for robust communication using RMI.  Any type
of remote communication has the possibility of intermittent errors.  Naive
programs using RMI often ignore this possibility, thus creating very fragile
implementations.  This class makes it easy to add appropriate retry abilility
to RMI method calls.  Note that calls which are retryable must be idempotent
(see {@link com.healthmarketscience.rmiio.RemoteRetry} for more details).
Also included is a base class
{@link com.healthmarketscience.rmiio.RemoteWrapper} which simplifies wrapping
remote interfaces for use with the RemoteRetry facility.  This allows code to
use a remote interface without having to implement the retry code directly
(see {@link com.healthmarketscience.rmiio.RemoteInputStreamWrapper} for
example usage).
</p>

<h3>Remote Streams</h3>

<p>
The bulk of this package is code to support streaming data over RMI.  There
are many ways to do this the wrong way.  Let us explore some possibilities.
(Note, all of these "solutions" were found online when searching for an
existing solution to this problem).
<dl>
<dt><b>Idea:</b> Send a File object over the wire.</dt>
<dd><b>Problem:</b> A File is only a String which describes the file, so you
are not actually sending any data, just a reference.</dd>
<dt><b>Idea:</b> Send a URL/File object, and let the server access the file
directly</dt>
<dd><b>Problem:</b> Only works if the server can access the same resources as
the client, which is very limiting in any enterprise scenario (cannot assume
common disk access, or even common host access)</dd>
<dt><b>Idea:</b> Send an InputStream.</dt>
<dd><b>Problem:</b> Besides the fact that none of the InputStream
implementatinos in java.io are Serializable, most of them rely on an
underlying source for the actual bytes, which be lost if the object was copied
remotely.</dd>
<dt><b>Idea:</b> Send a byte[] to the server</dt>
<dd><b>Problem:</b> This is the first scenario that kind of works... at least
until your files get to 1GB (or some large size which will not fit in memory),
in which case your client box may run out of memory trying to create the
byte[].  Again, not a very robust solution.</dd>
<dt><b>Idea:</b> Open a socket and stream the data to the server</dt>
<dd><b>Problem:</b> Well, we are getting the right idea, but again, opening a
socket between an arbitrary client and server can involve negotiating proxies
and firewalls, which is difficult at best.  Not to mention the additional work
of implementing socket based streaming, etc.</dd>
<dt><b>Idea:</b> Why not use the existing RMI connection to stream the data, by
sending the client chunks of the file at a time?</dt>
<dd><b>Solution:</b> Finally, the right idea.  But still not trivial to
implement.  Hopefully, though, this package should fill that need in a way
that is accessible for anyone who can use java.io based streams.</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
The {@link com.healthmarketscience.rmiio.RemoteInputStream} and {@link
com.healthmarketscience.rmiio.RemoteOutputStream} interfaces provide the basis
of the functionality for streaming data over RMI.  However, most users of this
package should never have to use or implement these interfaces directly.
There are wrappers for both the client and server implementations which wrap
these interfaces as regular java InputStreams or OutputStreams (including
usage of the RemoteRetry utility to automatically retry certain remote
exceptions), making them very easy to work with.

<p>
The examples below assume that the reader has knowledge of how RMI works.
</p>
<pre>

  //////
  // The "server" is reading a file from the "client"
  //
  
  // "server" implementation

  public void sendFile(RemoteInputStream inFile) {
    // wrap RemoteInputStream as InputStream (all compression issues are dealt
    // with in the wrapper code)
    InputStream istream = RemoteInputStreamClient.wrap(inFile);

    // ... read file here using normal InputStream code ...
  }

  // "client" implementation

  // create a RemoteStreamServer which uses compression over the wire (note
  // the finally block to release RMI resources no matter what happens)
  RemoteInputStreamServer istream = null;
  try {
    istream = new GZIPRemoteInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(
      new FileInputStream("myFile.txt")));
    // call server (note export() call to get actual remote interface)
    server.sendFile(istream.export());
  } finally {
    // since the server should have consumed the stream in the sendFile()
    // call, we always want to close the stream
    if(istream != null) istream.close();
  }


  //////
  // The "client" is reading a file from the "server"
  //
  
  // "server" implementation

  public RemoteInputStream getFile(String fileName) {
    // create a RemoteStreamServer (note the finally block which <i>only releases
    // the RMI resources if the method fails before returning.</i>)
    RemoteInputStreamServer istream = null;
    try {
      istream = new GZIPRemoteInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(
        new FileInputStream(fileName)));
      // export the final stream for returning to the client
      RemoteInputStream result = istream.export();
      // after all the hard work, discard the local reference (we are passing
      // responsibility to the client)
      istream = null;
      return result;
    } finally {
      // we will only close the stream here if the server fails before
      // returning an exported stream
      if(istream != null) istream.close();
    }
  }

  // "client" implementation

  // same as "server" part of previous example


  //////
  // The "server" is writing a file to the "client"
  //

  // "server" implementation

  public void getFile(RemoteOutputStream outFile) {
    // wrap RemoteOutputStream as OutputStream (all compression issues are
    // dealt with in the wrapper code)
    OutputStream istream = RemoteOutputStreamClient.wrap(inFile);

    // ... write file here using normal OutputStream code ...
  }


  // "client" implementation

  // create a RemoteStreamServer which uses no compression over the wire (note
  // the finally block to release RMI resources no matter what happens)
  RemoteOutputStreamServer ostream = null;
  try {
    ostream = new SimpleRemoteOutputStream(new BufferedOutputStream(
      new FileOutputStream("myResults.txt")));
    // call server (note export() call to get actual remote interface)
    server.getFile(ostream.export());
  } finally {
    // since the server should have done all the work in the getFile()
    // call, we always want to close the stream
    if(ostream != null) ostream.close();
  }


  //////
  // A more complicated example:  The "server" returns data streamed directly
  // out of a database.  The interesting situation here is that the database
  // connection lives longer than the initial method call, and will need to be
  // closed when the stream is closed.  To implement this, we use a
  // RemoteStreamMonitor which will be notified when the stream is closed
  // (among other things).
  //

  // "server" implementation (using jdbc)

  public RemoteInputStream getFile(String fileName) {
    Connection conn = null;
    try {

      conn = getConnection();
      Blob fileBlob = null;

      // ... do db work to get handle to a Blob ...
      
      // create RemoteInputStreamMonitor to close db connection when stream is
      // done
      final Connection streamConn = conn;
      RemoteInputStreamMonitor monitor = new RemoteInputStreamMonitor() {
        public void closed(RemoteInputStreamServer stream, boolean clean) {
          streamConn.close();
        }
      };

      // create server to stream blob bytes back using compression
      RemoteInputStream istream = new GZIPRemoteInputStream(
        fileBlob.getBinaryStream(), monitor).export();

      // the monitor has taken control of the db connection (note, we don't
      // set the conn to null until after the RemoteInputStream has been
      // exported, in case any exceptions occur in that process)
      conn = null;

      // return already exported RemoteInputStream
      return istream;

    } finally {
      if(conn != null) conn.close();
    }
  }

  // "client" implementation

  InputStream istream = null;
  try {

    istream = RemoteInputStreamClient.wrap(server.getFile("importFile.txt"));

    // ... read file here using normal InputStream code ...

  } finally {
    // do all we can to close the stream when finished
    if(istream != null) istream.close();
  }

</pre>

<h3>Remote Iterators</h3>

<p>
The {@link com.healthmarketscience.rmiio.RemoteIterator} facility is built on
top of the remote streams to enable streaming a large collection of objects
over RMI as easily as streaming a file.  Possible applications of this
facility might be reading a large collection of objects out of a remote
database, where the entire collection may not fit in memory at once.  While
the implementor of the RemoteIterator is free to use whatever method available
to convert the objects to a stream, the common usage would be to use
Serializable objects with the
{@link com.healthmarketscience.rmiio.SerialRemoteIteratorServer} and
{@link com.healthmarketscience.rmiio.SerialRemoteIteratorClient}.  Note
that the RemoteIterator interface is not actually a Remote interface.
Instead, the RemoteIterator implementation is a Serializable object which gets
copied across the wire.  Internally, it contains a reference to a
RemoteInputStream, from which it reads the objects being transferred.
</p>
<p>
The examples below assume that the reader has knowledge of how RMI works (as
well as how the remote streams above work).
</p>
<pre>

  //
  // The "server" returns a RemoteIterator of Strings from a database to the
  // "client".  We will use a similar trick used in the previous example to
  // close the db resources when the iterator is closed.
  //

  // "server" implementation (using jdbc)

  public RemoteIterator&lt;String&gt; getResults(String searchParam) {

    Connection conn = null;
    Statement stmt = null;
    ResultSet rs = null;
    try {

      // ... create ResultSet with relevant results ...
      
      // note, this is an *example* ResultSet iterator implementation, not the
      // cleanest in the world (doesn't handle all close scenarios, left as an
      // exercise to the reader)...
      final Connection iterConn = conn;
      final Statement iterStmt = stmt;
      final ResultSet iterRs = rs;
      IOIterator&lt;String&gt; dbIter = new IOIterator&lt;String&gt;() {
        private boolean _hasNext = iterRs.next();
        private String _next = (_hasNext ? iterRs.getString(1) : null);
        private boolean _isClosed = false;
        public boolean hasNext() throws IOException {
          if(!_hasNext && !_isClosed) {
            _isClosed = true;

                } finally {
                  iterConn.close();
                }
              }
            } catch(SQLException e) {
              throw new IOException(e);
            }
          }
          return _hasNext;
        }

            throw new IOException(e);
          }
          return cur;
        }
      };

      // create RemoteIterator client/server objects.  Note that the
      // RemoteInputStream export() call is handled internally to these
      // objects.
      SerialRemoteIteratorServer&lt;String&gt; stringServer =
        new SerialRemoteIteratorServer&lt;String&gt;(dbIter);
      SerialRemoteIteratorClient&lt;String&gt; stringClient =
        new SerialRemoteIteratorClient&lt;String&gt;(stringServer);

      // the RemoteIterator now owns the db resources
      rs = null;
      stmt = null;
      conn = null;
        
      return stringClient;

    } finally {

<h3>RemoteStreamExporter</h3>

<p>
While the streaming classes were originally designed for RMI, they can be
utilized on any similar RPC framework.  The {@link
com.healthmarketscience.rmiio.exporter.RemoteStreamExporter} class provides
the necessary hooks to control how the stream server implementation objects
are actually exposed remotely on the desired framework.  By {@linkplain
com.healthmarketscience.rmiio.exporter.DefaultRemoteStreamExporter default},
of course, the server implementations will export themselves using vanilla
RMI, but custom RemoteStreamExporter implementations can be used to export the
server implementations on other RPC frameworks (i.e. CORBA).
</p>

<a name="Usage_Notes"><!-- --></a><h3>Usage Notes</h3>

<p>
Writing distributed applications is not easy, and adding streaming to the mix
further complicates things.  These utilities <em>should</em> make life easier,
if used correctly.  Included below are some recommendations learned through
the shedding of much blood, sweat, and many tears.
</p>

<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
<li>As the examples above show, you should treat all your remote stream (and
    iterator) objects like JDBC resources (or other important resources) and
    <em>always, always</em> consume the remote streams within a try/finally
    block which closes the streams no matter what happens.  Each remote stream
    object is consuming resources on the server, so "leaking" a remote stream
    could have an impact on the overall performance of the server.
</li>
<li>Due to RMI's distributed garbage collection, you need to be careful when
    using a debugger with remote streams (or any other similar transient RMI
    server object).  If your client code stops on a breakpoint for too long,
    the server may determine that the server object is unused and close it.
    When your client continues after the breakpoint, you will then receive
    some sort of RemoteException, such as "no object found in table".  One
    technique for debugging remote streams is to implement a remote stream
    monitor which outputs useful debug messages because this won't otherwise
    interfere with the normal running of the system (other than the normal
    overhead for debug messages).
</li>
<li>This is a general RMI note, but it's worth repeating here.  The return
    value from a remote stream server <tt>export()</tt> method call is a
    remote stub.  A remote stub is just a little serializable object which
    knows how to access the server remotely.  As such, it can be returned from
    a remote method call (the normal use case), but can just as easily be
    embedded within another serializable object which is returned from a
    remote method call.  (This is actually used by the remote iterators, where
    the remote iterator client object is a small serializable object which
    uses a remote stream under the hood.  The reference to the exported remote
    stream server is serialized along with the rest of the remote iterator
    client object when returned from a remote method call.)
</li>
</ul>

<h4>JDBC</h4>
<ul>
<li>As noted in some of the examples above, these utilities can be used to
    stream data directly out of a database.  While this can be really useful,
    keep in mind that the database resources will be (generally) used
    <em>past</em> the end of the method call.  Most importantly, this means
    that you need to make sure the resources will get cleaned up when the
    stream server is finished (when the close method is called on the remote
    stream).  As shown above, the stream monitors can be very handy for
    implementing the JDBC cleanup on remote stream close.  Additionally, you
    need to make sure that you are careful when handing-off the JDBC resources
    to the stream server, so that they get closed <em>even if the method call
    exits abnormally</em>.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>EJB</h4>
<ul>
<li>Related to the first point in the JDBC section, any EJB methods which
    return a remote stream object which uses transacted resources <b>must</b>
    use bean managed transactions for that method (if any transactions are
    necessary).  The relevant EJB methods should be marked with transaction
    type <tt>"Never"</tt>, and any necessary transactional code must be
    handled when the remote stream server closes, <em>not</em> when the method
    call returns.  (See first point in the JDBC section).
</li>
<li>A particularly insidious gotcha can result from using remote streams
    returned from a "local" interface.  While this might seem like a
    reasonable thing to do, the java RMI server code seems to think that there
    are no references to the server object, and in a short amount of time,
    removes the server RMI reference (at least when using Sun's JDK 1.5 jvm).
    Short stream transfers may work, but longer ones will die with a "no
    object found in table" or similar error message part way through the
    transfer.  It may have something to do with actually
    serializing/unserializing the client stub, as using a remote stream which
    is returned from a "remote" interface even within the same jvm
    <em>will</em> work correctly.  The cleanest solution, however, is to
    create the "local" and "remote" interface methods with slightly different
    interfaces, where the "remote" interface method returns a remote stream,
    and the "local" interface method returns a simple stream.
</li>
</ul>
