/**
 * Convenience base class for CloseableIOIterator implementations, especially
 * suited for use as the local iterator for a RemoteIteratorServer
 * instance.  This implementation manages the closing of the local resources
 * through three separate mechanisms.  The {@link #close} method will be
 * called:
 * <ul>
 * <li>by the {@link #next} method when the {@link #hasNext} method starts
 *     returning {@code false}</li>
 * <li>when the close method is called directly (duh)</li>
 * <li>if used with a RemoteIteratorServer, when the server is shutdown</li>
 * </ul>
 * This three-pronged attack provides a pretty strong guarantee that the local
 * resources will be closed at some point in time.  Note that the
 * implementation of the {@link #close} method will call the
 * {@link #closeImpl} method at most once.  Extraneous invocations will be
 * ignored.
