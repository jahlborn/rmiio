/**
 * Utility class which can be used to simulate a socket-like connection over
 * RMI.  A single RMISocket instance enables only a single direction of
 * communication (from the remote system to this system), in which case the
 * instantiator of the RMISocket is an RMI server (essentially serving a
 * {@link RemoteOutputStream}).  In order for bi-directional communication to
 * take place, each system must have an instance of RMISocket and the relevant
 * Sources should be exchanged, in which case <i>both</i> systems will be
 * acting as RMI servers.
 * <p>
 * In general, simulating a socket connection over RMI is probably not the
 * best idea, and should not be pursued for a <i>new</i> project.  However,
 * when revamping an existing project, it may be desirable to layer an
 * existing socket-based protocol over a separately established RMI
 * connection.  In such a situation, this utility could be very useful.
