 * words, should never be used alone, use the utility classes).
 * <p>

 * correctly), and can therefore be retried as necessary in the face of
 * RemoteExceptions.

 * An actual instance of this class is not intended for use by more than one
 * client, and should be treated in a similar manner to an "un-synchronized"
 * local interface.
