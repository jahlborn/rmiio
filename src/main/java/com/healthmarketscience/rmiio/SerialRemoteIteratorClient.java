/**
 * Implementation of RemoteIteratorClient which uses java serialization to
 * receive objects from the RemoteIteratorServer.  Objects are deserialized
 * from the underlying remote input stream as needed and returned to the
 * ultimate consumer of the objects.
 * <p>
 * Note, the objects are read from the ObjectInputStream using the
 * {@link java.io.ObjectInputStream#readUnshared} method.  This is because
 * memory can build up in the ObjectInputStream over time and a large data set
 * can run the client and/or server out of memory.  In general, the objects
 * being iterated over most likely do not have shared references, so nothing
 * will be lost by this choice.  However, if shared references are desired,
 * the {@link #deserializeObject} method can be overriden by a custom subclass
 * to change this behavior.
